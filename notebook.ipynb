Artificial Intelligence enhancing automation is also causing hugejoblosses aroundtheworld. AccordingtoaForbes article, it is predictedthatby2025automation will cause a loss of 85 million jobs.\\n[6] \\nBigger fears regarding AIincludes thescenariowhereas machines becomesmarter andsmartertheygoingtoend up being as opinionated and biased like some of the people training it.Automatization of weapons is also a big reason people worry about thefutureofArtificial Intelligence. The idea that weapons can be used to search and targetsomeonewithpre-programmedinstructions andthemisuseofthisbygovernmentsor mafias or rogue AI can be something very deadly and devastating. However,there are many myths in disguise of concerns surrounding AI that spreads panicandmisinformation. AI todayis nowherenear tobecomeasuper-intelligententityand turn into our overlords like in sci-fi movies. However, heavyregulations andcautions are being advised by Big Tech giants like Elon Musk while developingthis industry.\\nArtificial Intelligence and The Future\\nIt is said that AI is thegreatest thinghumankindhas ever workedon. AI is beingused in image and speech recognition and analysis which will be far better thanhuman recognition of image and speech and its applicationstretches wide and far.ThereareresearchandworksbeingconductedusingAIthatisgoingtoplayaveryimportant roleinour futurehealthcare. AI is beingworkedontocureAlzheimer’sdisease and someday even blindness. Someone with dyslexia is being helped toread better with the help of AI. Geneticdatais beinganalyzedbybioinformatics;data science integrated with AI for waybetter dataanalysis inhealthcarethat hasnot been possible for us in the past. Fields like cancer research and other suchdiseases are being impacted greatly by advanced applications of AI. AI can be a', 'great tool in the future of education. AI can be used to analyze data fromanindividual’s personal andintellectual needs, capabilities, choicesandlimitationstodevelop customized curriculum, strategies and schedules that will be more wellsuited, appeallingandinclusiveof most, if not all,childrenandadults.TheusesofAI are also going to change the way we are going to commute in the future. Inaddition to self-driving cars, work is being done to manufacture “self-flying”planes anddrones that convenientlydeliver your foodfaster andbetter.Oneofthebiggest concerns about AI is that jobs are being replaced due to automation.However, AI might be creating more jobs than it replaces. This will change theway humans work by creating new types of jobs.\\nSource: https://hackernoon.com/artificial-intelligence-and-big-data-zys3258\\nAI is still in a fairlypreliminary(but rapidlygrowing) stagetodayandit requiresmore and more training to develop.

Artificial Intelligence enhancing automation is also causing hugejoblosses aroundtheworld. AccordingtoaForbes article, it is predictedthatby2025automation will cause a loss of 85 million jobs.\\n[6] \\nBigger fears regarding AIincludes thescenariowhereas machines becomesmarter andsmartertheygoingtoend up being as opinionated and biased like some of the people training it.Automatization of weapons is also a big reason people worry about thefutureofArtificial Intelligence. The idea that weapons can be used to search and targetsomeonewithpre-programmedinstructions andthemisuseofthisbygovernmentsor mafias or rogue AI can be something very deadly and devastating. However,there are many myths in disguise of concerns surrounding AI that spreads panicandmisinformation. AI todayis nowherenear tobecomeasuper-intelligententityand turn into our overlords like in sci-fi movies. However, heavyregulations andcautions are being advised by Big Tech giants like Elon Musk while developingthis industry.\\nArtificial Intelligence and The Future\\nIt is said that AI is thegreatest thinghumankindhas ever workedon. AI is beingused in image and speech recognition and analysis which will be far better thanhuman recognition of image and speech and its applicationstretches wide and far.ThereareresearchandworksbeingconductedusingAIthatisgoingtoplayaveryimportant roleinour futurehealthcare.
